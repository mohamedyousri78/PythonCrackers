# Path Finder Application

Welcome to our Path Finder Application.
> This app manages the user to find the path between two cities in menoufia and can be extended to wider regions.

Here we **briefly** talk about the application parts and their functions.

## Fetch Data
It's a python script used to get the heurstic distances between each pair of cities.

## GUI 
> GUI is made using Tkniter and customized Tkinter modules in Python.
* The application window is divided into two parts.
* First part is the control panal part that contains the options of the search (Source, Destination and Searching Algorithm used).
* Second part is the map frame at which the map exists and the result we want appears on it.

### This sample shows the result of finding path from (Elsadat) to (Quisna) using A* search algorithm.

## Algorithms
This application supports 4 algorithms.
* DFS which starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
* BFS which starts at the treeâ€™s root or graph and visits all nodes at the current depth level before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.
* Uniform cost which makes use of the weights on edges in order to deduce the shortest path between two nodes.
* A* search which makes use of both the weights on edges and the heuristic data between cities in order to deduce the shortest path between two nodes.
